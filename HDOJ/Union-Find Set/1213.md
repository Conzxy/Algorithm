# How many tables
## 问题描述
Today is Ignatius' birthday. He invites a lot of friends. Now it's dinner time. Ignatius wants to know how many tables he needs at least. You have to notice that not all the friends know each other, and all the friends do not want to stay with strangers.

One important rule for this problem is that if I tell you A knows B, and B knows C, that means A, B, C know each other, so they can stay in one table.

For example: If I tell you A knows B, B knows C, and D knows E, so A, B, C can stay in one table, and D, E have to stay in the other one. So Ignatius needs 2 tables at least.

## 输入要求
The input starts with an integer T(1<=T<=25) which indicate the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case starts with two integers N and M(1<=N,M<=1000). N indicates the number of friends, the friends are marked from 1 to N. Then M lines follow. Each line consists of two integers A and B(A!=B), that means friend A and friend B know each other. There will be a blank line between two cases.

## 输出要求
For each test case, just output how many tables Ignatius needs at least. Do NOT print any blanks.

## 基本思路
很简单的并查集问题，情景也好理解，故略

## 实现代码
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
const int maxsize=1e5;
int fa[maxsize];
int cnt=0;

int x,n,m,u,v;

void init(int n)
{
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    fa[i]=i;
}

int findset(int x)
{
  return (fa[x]==x)?x:(fa[x]=findset(fa[x]));
}

void Union(int v,int u)
{
  int vv=findset(v);
  int uu=findset(u);
  if(vv!=uu)
    fa[uu]=vv;
}

int main()
{
  cin>>x;
  while(x>=1&&x<=25)
  {
    cin>>n>>m;
    init(n);

    while(m--)
    {
      cin>>u>>v;
      if(u<=1000&&u>=1&&v<=1000&&v>=1)
        Union(u-1,v-1);
    }

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
      if(fa[i]==i)
        cnt++;

    cout<<cnt<<endl;
    cnt=0;
    x--;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
